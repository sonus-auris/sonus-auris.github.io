# sonus-auris.github.io

Marketing website for **Sonus Auris** — *a dashcam for audio*. An always-on
recording app that keeps a rolling buffer of your audio and backs it up,
encrypted, to the cloud. Built for musicians who don't want to lose the riff,
and for anyone who wants an honest record when memory isn't enough.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build). No client application framework — just
fast static HTML/CSS, inline SVG animation, and one integrity-pinned,
framework-neutral ORES Chat footer component.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321
```

[`flags-2-env`](https://github.com/ORESoftware/flags-2-env) can validate and
override Astro's host, port, canonical site URL, and base path:

```sh
scripts/with-flags help
scripts/with-flags audit
scripts/with-flags --host=127.0.0.1 --port=4321 -- npm run dev
scripts/with-flags --site=https://example.test --base=/preview -- npm run build
```

The wrapper builds the monorepo's pinned native source into a commit-keyed user
cache, or uses `FLAGS2ENV_BIN` in a standalone checkout.

## Build

```bash
npm run build    # outputs to ./dist
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

## Test

```bash
npm run check    # build + static legal/download/metadata/link verification
npm run test:e2e # Playwright: real Chromium against the production build
```

`npm run test:e2e` builds the site and serves it with `astro preview`, then
drives that exact static output: every route renders with no console/page
errors and no third-party requests, internal links and in-page anchors resolve,
off-origin links are https with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, nothing scrolls
horizontally at 390px or 1440px, the release-critical privacy/product copy is
visible, and a build made from hostile deployment variables degrades to the
"coming soon" state instead of rendering an active URL. First run needs
`npx playwright install chromium`; `npm run test:e2e:ui` opens the runner UI.

The suite builds with placeholder store and download URLs (see
`playwright.config.ts`) so the "downloads are configured" rendering path is
covered regardless of local `.env`. Nothing is ever fetched from those hosts.

## Release links

The site is static and never proxies installer bytes. Mobile store URLs and
desktop installer URLs are injected at build time:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Set PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL / PUBLIC_PLAY_STORE_URL after listings are public.
# Set PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL to the Cloudflare R2 custom domain.
npm run build
```

`PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` expands to these stable aliases:

- `latest/sonus-auris-windows-x64.exe`
- `latest/sonus-auris-macos-universal.dmg`
- `latest/sonus-auris-linux-x86_64.deb`

A per-platform `PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_*_URL` overrides its alias. The release pipeline
must upload immutable, versioned objects first, then replace the `/latest`
aliases with `Cache-Control: no-store`. Large binaries go directly from the R2
custom domain to the user; the Rust server may expose release metadata or issue
redirects, but it must not become a bandwidth proxy for public installers.

### Desktop alpha builds

Separate from the stable per-OS installers above, `DesktopDownloads.astro`
gates the pre-release desktop clients, split by runtime. Set
`PUBLIC_RUST_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` and
`PUBLIC_FLUTTER_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` to the stable R2 alpha prefixes, or
`PUBLIC_DESKTOP_TESTERS_URL` to a restricted Google Drive folder while R2 is
being activated. If none is set, the site shows an honest non-clickable
“Downloads opening soon” state rather than a dead link.

Each directory also has its own `README.md` describing what lives there.

## Things to wire up before launch

Still open:

- Configure the store listing and download URLs in the site deployment
  environment — `PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL`, `PUBLIC_PLAY_STORE_URL`, and
  `PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_{BASE,WINDOWS,MACOS,LINUX}_URL`, all read by
  `StoreButtons.astro`. Never link to unsigned or unreviewed artifacts.

Standing rules, not tasks:

- `Partners.astro` — the footer row shows **neutral capability badges** (Sound
  matching, Sleep & snore, Music capture, Clear audio), NOT third-party
  endorsements. Do not reintroduce real organisation/brand names without written
  permission — that would imply an affiliation Sonus Auris does not have.
- The publisher identity that the legal pages render lives in one place,
  `src/data/publisher.ts`. Keep it accurate: App Review and the Play Console
  both check that a privacy policy names a real controller and a reachable
  contact.

Already done (this section previously said otherwise):

- Legal-entity name, contact email, and postal address are filled in via
  `src/data/publisher.ts`, and the "Before publishing" banner is gone. The
  `tests/site/legal.test.mjs` release gate in `sonus-auris-e2e` no longer has
  placeholders to find — verified against the built `dist/` HTML.
- `astro.config.mjs` `site` resolves to the production domain
  (`requestedSite || productionSite`), overridable per build.
- GitHub links point at `github.com/sonus-auris/sonus-auris-ui.dart`, which
  exists; the old note here named a repo that does not.

## Theme

Green + orange, rounded **Baloo 2** type, music / party / driving cartoon
doodles. Fun but professional.
